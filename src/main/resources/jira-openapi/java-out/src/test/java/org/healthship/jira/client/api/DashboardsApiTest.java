Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their dashboards. For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).

The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item is configurable, the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to store the item&#39;s content or configuration details.
