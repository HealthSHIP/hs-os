                <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
                <p>We use cookies on our web site, https://healthship.org. This policy
                    explains why and how we do that.</p>

                <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

                <p>Cookies are small text files which a web site may put on your computer or
                    mobile device when you visit a site or page. The cookie helps the
                    web site to recognise your device. We use the term "cookies" in this policy
                    to refer to all files that collect information in this way.</p>

                <p>There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember
                your username and preferences, analyse how well the web site is performing,
                    or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.</p>

                <p>Certain cookies contain personal information &mdash; for example, if you
                    click to "remember me" when logging in, a cookie will store your user identifier.</p>

                <h3>The Cookies we use</h3>

                <p>At the time of writing (18 Mar 2020), the list below represents a comprehensive
                list of all cookies set on the HealthSHIP. The purposes of the cookies in use,
                    as described below, will not change without this policy being updated.</p>

                <h3>Category: Strictly necessary</h3>

                <p>HealthSHIP uses a single cookie to enable the essential features of the web site, such
                    as logging in and allowing you to browse requests for help.</p>

                <p>No other cookies are used.</p>

                <h3>Can you block cookies?</h3>

                <p>It is possible to block cookies, although if you do choose to
                    disable cookies, you won't be able to use this site.</p>

                <p>However, if you do wish to disable cookies then you can do so by
                    amending the settings within your browser or mobile device. The links
                    below show you how to disable cookies in some common browsers:</p>
