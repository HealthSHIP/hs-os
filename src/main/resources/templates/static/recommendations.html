                <p>HealthSHIP is a small part of this mobilisation which hopes to assist front line healthcare workers
                    during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, compassion and goodwill is fundamental to our ethos, and we
                    don't have the resources or the time to develop robust Health and Safety Policy currently. Users
                    engage at their own risk - please see our disclaimer before proceeding. Below is some information
                    which aims to keep the users of this movement safe as we try to balance the risk and with the
                    benefit of helping our front line.

                <h1>Recommendations</h1>

                <p>When not aiding others, we strongly recommend social distancing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults" target="_blank">Please see this</a> and give particular attention to the section on <em>Advice for informal carers</em>.</p>
                <p>If you have any underlying health concerns, or are in contact with anyone with underlying health concerns, please do not participate.  We want you to stay safe!</p>
                <p>We also strongly encourage Random Acts of Kindness: if you think something might make someone's day &mdash; do it!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bring with you any disclosure and criminal record check certificates (ie. PVG, DBS, Garda, etc),
                        especially for caring tasks
                    </li>
                    <li>Bring a government issued photo ID</li>
                    <li>Please also ask the staff member for a photo ID</li>
                    <li>Be willing to meet the family before the first caring/babysitting session</li>
                    <li>If you are helping staff members at night, we recommend to do so in pairs, preferably pairs that live in the same household</li>
                    <li>Follow all the appropriate guidance to protect yourselves and others against COVID transmission
                    </li>
                    <li>We strongly encourage trying to work with the same family multiple times to reduce the chance of
                        COVID transmission
                    </li>
                    <li>If you or anyone close to you has symptoms suggestive of COVID, do not accept a task. If you
                        already have one scheduled, let the staff member know and do not attend your task.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>For staff</h2>

                    </li>
                    <li>If you are a staff member helping another staff member, please check each other's
                        official health service IDs or relevant criminal record check</li>
                    <li>Please show the student your photo ID</li>
                    <li>You might feel more comfortable arranging a meet and greet ahead of a full caring/babysitting
                        session. That's ok and encouraged!
                    </li>
                    <li>We strongly encourage trying to work with the same student multiple times to reduce the chance
                        of COVID transmission
                    </li>
                    <li>If you or anyone in your home has symptoms suggestive of COVID, please do not request a task. If
                        you have already made arrangements with a student, let them know and do <span
                                class="font-weight-bold">not</span> allow them to fulfil their task.

                <h3>Some simple transferable advice for all:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water. Use a sanitiser gel if soap and water are not
                        available. When washing your hands do it for 20 seconds i.e. the duration of the time it takes
                        to sing 'happy birthday' twice and make sure it is thorough.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wash your hands when you get to work or arrive home, after you blow your nose, cough or sneeze,
                        after using public transport, and before you eat or handle food.
                    </li>
                    <li>Always carry tissues with you and use them to catch your cough or sneeze. Then bin the tissue,
                        and wash your hands, or use a sanitiser gel.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                    <li>Avoid close contact with people who are unwell.</li>
                    <li>Clean and disinfect regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning products.
                    </li>
                </ul>
