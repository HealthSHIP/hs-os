                    These terms and the other policies posted on our platform (our Privacy Notice and our Cookie Policy)
                    constitute the entire agreement between HealthSHIP and you, superseding any prior agreements. No
                    agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is
                    intended or created by these terms. </p>
                <p>
                    These terms shall be governed and construed in all respects by the laws of Scotland. You agree that
                    any claim or dispute you may have against HealthSHIP must be resolved by the courts of Scotland. You
                    and HealthSHIP both agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish Courts. </p>
                <p>
                    If we do not enforce any particular provision, we are not waiving our right to do so later. </p>
                <p>
                    If a court strikes down any of these terms, the remaining terms will survive. </p>
                <p>
                    We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always
                    inform you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your
                    rights under these terms. </p>
                <p>

                    after we post the updated terms on our platform, whichever is sooner. You accept any updates to
                    these terms by your continued use of the services. No other amendment to these terms will be
