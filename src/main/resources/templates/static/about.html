                <h2>About HealthSHIP</h2>

                <p class="font-weight-bold">Health Students Helping In Pandemics</p>

                <p>Hi! We are HealthSHIP, a student-led social movement rooted in compassion for the health of our
                    communities.</p>

                <p>We aim to support health and social care staff with everyday tasks from caring responsibilities to
                    grocery shopping. We believe the impact of COVID-19 will span the entirety of our social fabrics and
                    that each have a role to play in the hindrance of this pandemic.</p>

                <p>Students may not be able to work on the front line yet, but we can support those that do.</p>
