                    provide (the "Services") or may contact us in relation to the Website or the Services. If you do not
                    agree with any part of this privacy notice, then we cannot make the Services available to you

                <p>We encourage you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to navigate to from the
                    Website so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. We

                    protection law, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
                    2016/679) and the Data Protection Act 2018 ("Applicable Data Protection Law"). Definitions in this
                    privacy notice shall be as set out in the Applicable Data Protection Law. For the purposes of this

                <h3>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>

                <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law or in order to provide the Services and if you fail to
                    provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the Services for you (for example,
                    to provide you with a match nearby). In this case, we may have to cancel the Services for you but we
                    will notify you if this is the case at the time.  </p>

                <h2>How we will use your personal data </h2>

                <p>We collect and use your personal information to operate the Website and deliver the Services as
                    requested by you. We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we
                    will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>where we need to perform the Services offered by us; or</li>
                    <li>for the purposes of our legitimate interests; or</li>
                    <li>where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Legitimate interests means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to
                    enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure
                    we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights
                    before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data
                    for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent
                    or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we
                    assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific
                    activities by contacting us.</p>

                <p>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data (please see
                    the section on "Marketing" below).</p>

                <p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal
                    data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate
                    interests are where appropriate.</p>

                <p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific
                    purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific
                    legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set
                    out in the table below.</p>

                    the legal basis which allows us to do so. </p>

                <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance
                    with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. </p>


                <h2>Transfer of Personal Data</h2>

                <p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in
                    the table above: </p>

                        legal, insurance and accounting services; and
                    </li>
                    <li>third-party analytics partners who are used to analyse website traffic or understand customer
                        needs and trends.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>All such third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and to treat
                    your personal data in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to
                    use your personal data for their own purposes and do not permit them to process your personal
                    data. </p>

                <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA or UK, we ensure a similar degree of
                    protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
                    implemented: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                        adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details,
                        see

                            Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a>.

                    <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European
                        Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details,
                        see

                    </li>

                    <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the
                        Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between
                        the Europe and the US. For further details, see <a

                </ul>

                <p>We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in
                    the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or the website

                    <li>protect and defend our rights; and,</li>

                <h3>Data Security</h3>

                <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
                    accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we
                    limit access to your personal data to those organisers who have a business need to know. They will
                    only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
                    confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and
                    will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

                <p>Your passwords are stored in our database in encrypted form. We do not disclose your account details,
                    postal or email addresses to anyone except with your permission, or when legally required to do so.
                    However, it is your responsibility to keep your password secure. Unfortunately, the transmission of
                    information via the internet is not completely secure. Although HealthSHIP will do its best to
                    protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the
                    Platform, any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use
                    strict procedures and security features to try and prevent any unauthorised access.</p>

                <h3>Data retention</h3>

                <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected
                    it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
                    requirements.</p>

                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
                    your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                    those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Data reviewed regularly
                    for relevance. Any data deemed no longer relevant is deleted. We shall keep your personal data for
                    at least six months from the date of the last interaction for insurance and liability purposes. We
                    shall keep emails of clients and prospective clients for as long as it has a legitimate interest to
                    do so. You can request details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data by
                    contacting via our <a href="/contact">contact form</a>.</p>

                <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated
                    with you) for analytical, research and statistical purposes and to help us to improve our products
                    and services, in which case this is no longer personal data and we may use this information
                    indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

                <h1>Your Legal Rights</h1>

                <p>You have the right to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").</span>
                        This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we
                        are lawfully processing it.

                    <li><span
                            class="font-weight-bold">Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</span>
                        This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though
                        we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Request erasure of your personal data.</span> This enables you to
                        ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
                        process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you
                        have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have
                        processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to
                        comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request
                        of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time
                        of your request.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest</span>
                        and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
                        processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You
                        also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
                        purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
                        process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</span>
                        This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following
                        scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is
                        unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we
                        no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you
                        have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                        legitimate grounds to use it.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</span>
                        We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
                        commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated
                        information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information
                        to perform a contract with you.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.</span>
                        However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
                        your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or
                        services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>No fee usually required</h3>

                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
                    excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

                <h3>What we may need from you</h3>

                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
                    right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
                    measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
                    We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
                    our response.</p>

                <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>

                <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within three months. Occasionally it may take us longer
                    than a month if your request is particularly complex, you have made a number of requests or if the
                    organisation is in a state of emergency due to a pandemic. In this case, we will notify you and keep
                    you updated.</p>

                <h1>Changes to this Privacy Notice</h1>

                <p>We will occasionally update this privacy notice to reflect the organisation and user feedback and any
                    changes in data protection regulations. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy notice
                    to be informed of how we are protecting your information. </p>
